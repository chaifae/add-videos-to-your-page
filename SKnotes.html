          Basics of Web and HTML

          <p>
            The <em>World Wibe Web</em> is a collection of documents, most are made up of HTML. The browser reads, interprets, and displays these documents. Servers are computers that host files that make up the web. Computers make requests via the internet to servers, the internet and servers communicate through http. HTTP is the main protocol of the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Coding</em> is when programmers write text in a language computers understand, so the computer can follow the instructions. Computers are stupid, even a small mistake like a typo can break the whole program.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Basic HTML vocabulary:</em><br>
            <em>Tag</em> - HTML tags are always contained in angle brackets. Most tags have opening and closing tags (designated with a forward-slash), but some tags called void tags do not require a closing tag. There are inline tags and block tags - block tags create an invisible box or container around the content that has a height and width, while inline tags do something within the line.<br>
            <em>Element</em> - An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
            <em>Attribute</em> - This is a property of an HTML element, such as the source in an image tag.

          Creating a Structured Document with HTML

        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            <em>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</em> is the structure of a webpage. HTML is the standard markup language used to create webpages.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>DOM (Document Object Model)</em> refers to the tree-like structure of a webpage. DOM is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in markup languages. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            Websites are all made up of boxes, with boxes inside those boxes, and more boxes inside those. Box-ception. When reading the HTML you can see the "boxes" by the indentation in the code - the further indented the code is the deeper the visual box is nested.

          Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure
        </h2>
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            <em>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</em> creates the style of a webpage. CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Cascading</em> part of CSS means that rules are applied to the elements they directly match as well as that element's child elements, like a waterfall will wet every stone from the top to the bottom. This idea is known as <em>inheritance</em>. If a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rules take precedence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Avoiding repetition</b> is very important in programming. It helps avoid errors when you don't have to rewrite the same thing over and over again - there is always the risk of typos! Avoiding repetition also helps with creating consistency. With CSS, you can apply the same style to everything of the same element, like I have done with all of the div tags with the class "lesson" here. Because of that, it is now very easy for me to make changes to all of the lessons' style at once.

          Telling Computers What to Do
        </h2>
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            A computer is a <em>universal machine</em>, that means it can be programmed to do anything we want it to do, unlike machines like a vacuum cleaner that can only do their one function. A program is a precise sequence of steps for a computer to follow. Some examples of programs are web browsers, video games, and instant messaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            We create new languages for computers rather than using natural languages like English because of the ambiguity and verbosity of natural languages. We want to be able to tell the computer precicely what to do without requiring a large amount of text. Programming languages have grammar rules just like natural languages, but we must follow the rules exactly for the program to work. An <em>expression</em> in code is a legal statement, one that follows the grammar rules of the programming language.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Python</em> is a programming language. When you run Python code, a Python interpreter converts the code into instructions for the computer to execute.

          Variables and Strings
        </h2>
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            A <em>variable</em> is a way to give a name to a value so you can easily reference and use that value later. You assign a value to a variable using the equal sign, such as my_age = 23. Variables are useful in storing data and also in referencing that data in a way that makes sense to humans reading the code. Using variables also allows us to easily change the value of something, like days +=1.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Python, 5 is a number (or integer), while "5" is a <em>string</em>. Everything within quotes (either single quotes or double quotes) is a string. Running the code 2 + 3 would give us 5, but the code "2" + "3" gives "23" because it is concatenating (squishing together) the two strings.

          Functions
        </h2>
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            Functions take <em>input</em>, do something with the input, and produce <em>output</em>. A function named "add" might take two numbers as input and output the sum of them. Once you create a function, you can reuse it in the code without having to redefine it each time, which helps to avoid repetition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functions are created by starting a line with def and following with the function name and the parameters/arguments in parenthesis, followed by a colon. The next lines will be the body of the function, and they will be indented.
          </p>
          <pre>def add(a, b):
      return a + b</pre>
          <p>
            The return keyword tells Python what the function needs to output. A function without a return statement doesn't do anything that the user can see.
          </p>
          <p>
            To use or call a funtion you type the name of the function with the arguments/parameters you want to use in parenthesis, like add(2, 3)

          Repetition, Loops, and Structured Data
        </h2>
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            <em>If statements</em> let us control what part of the code is executed. If the condition is True, the indented block of code will execute. If not the interpreter moves on without executed the block under the if statement. An <em>else statement</em> under an if statement is executed when the if statement was not True.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>While statements</em> will loop through the indented block of code until the condition is no longer met. Both while and if statements use comparision operators, like greater than or less than, to return the Boolean values True and False.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Lists</em> are sequences of data contained in square brackets [ ] and can contain any combination of numbers, strings, or Boolean values. Lists can even contain other lists. <em>For loops</em> allow you to iterate over lists.

          How to Solve Problems
        </h2>
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            The first step to solving any problem is to understand the inputs and outputs. The inputs are anything the program will be responsible for processing, while the outputs are the desired response we want the function to provide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you start coding, it is often useful to work through some examples by hand and develop a simple mechanical solution that we can base the function off of. Then once you start coding, develop the code in small parts and test as you go. It's easier to fix problems as they arise than to have to find and fix all the problems at the end!

          Libraries - Using Code Already Written
        </h2>
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            Python comes equipped with the <em>Python Standard Library</em>, a database of useful code already written that programmers can <em>import</em> and use in their programs. These modules are different from the <em>built-in functions</em>, which are available to use without having to import anything. The Standard Library has a lot of files, called <em>modules</em>, that have pre-built functions and classes that we can use in our code. If we type "import some_module" into our code, all of some_module's functions will be able for us to use. However, if we only want to use one thing from a module we can type "from some_module import some_function", this way we are only importing the one some_function we want to use without having to import all of the other stuff in the module.
          </p>
          <p>
            An <em>External Library</em> is a library that someone has written that does not come packaged with Python, such as Twilio. As long as we have the external library downloaded, we can import twilio or certain parts of twilio to use in our code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because there is so much code available to use, it is important to read the documentation so we can find exactly what we want and really understand what we are using.

          Object Oriented Programming
        </h2>
        <div class="notes">
          <p>
            <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> (shortened as OOP) more closely resembles the way the real world operates, which allows programmers to think about programs in a way they are familiar with. OOP allows for less repetition of code, so it is a really valuable tool when thinking about large programming projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <em>class</em> is a blueprint or instructions for creating a new kind of object. An <em>object</em> is any <em>instance</em> of a particular class. So a class Cat would have all the instructions for creating a cat object - such as a cat has four legs, fur whiskers, and a tail, and a cat can run and meow. We don't have a cat right now, just the blueprint for a cat. You create an instance of cat by typing kairo = Cat() Now we can set Kairo's attributes, like how he has black fur and meows quietly. We can also create another instance, named Chloe, with white fur and loud meows. With very little code we now have two distinct objects, and could keep creating more and more objects this way reusing the same class code.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Instance methods</em> are functions that belong to an instance of a class, typically they are used to set or get information about the particular object they are attached to. <em>Class variables</em> are variables defined within a class or within an instance of the class, like in the above example, kairo.fur_color = black would be an example of a class variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Inheritance</em> is another concept with classes. Inheritance allows classes to inherit traits from a parent class, like truck and car would both inherit traits from the class vehicle. A truck is a vehicle, and a car is a vehicle, but a truck and a car are different even though they share enough in common to come from the same parent class, such as having wheels and an engine. Inheritance even applies to functions in a class, so sub-classes can have the same functions as the parent. The subclasses can also override the function to do something different, this is called <em>method overriding</em>. This is similar to the cascading part of CSS, where child classes inherit properties from the parent class, but the more specific rules for the child take precedence.
